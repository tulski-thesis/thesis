## Diagrams

This directory contains diagrams for the thesis. Made with [Diagrams](https://diagrams.mingrammer.com/). 

It requires Python 3.7 or higher, check your Python version first.
It uses Graphviz to render the diagram, so you need to install Graphviz to use diagrams. After installing graphviz (or already have it), install the diagrams.
macOS users can download the Graphviz via brew install graphviz if you're using Homebrew.

```bash
pip3 install diagrams
```
