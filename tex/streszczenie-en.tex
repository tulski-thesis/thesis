The Thesis focuses on web scraping --- a technique for extracting information from the Internet.
It considers it from two perspectives, i.e.~ its conducting and securing against it.
The theoretical basis of web scraping, its practical applications and various techniques for executing it are presented.
The three-stage process is described in detail: data retrieval, processing, and saving and presentation,
Special emphasis was placed on web scraping detection methods, including rate limiting,
use of reverse proxies with bot blocking rules, and browser fingerprinting.
The scraper and detection methods were presented as a case study, using a testing platform (an online store).
The described and implemented security features were tested in several scenarios: each independently and their fusion.
Attention was paid to the importance of web scraping as a tool for effective data acquisition, as well as to the essence of effective methods for its detection.
