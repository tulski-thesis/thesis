\abstract
The paper focuses on web scraping --- a technique for extracting information from the Internet.
Both the perspective of conducting the technique mentioned and securing against it are included.
The theoretical basis of web scraping, its practical applications and various techniques for conducting it are presented.
This three-stage process is described in detail: data retrieval, processing, and saving and presentation.
Special emphasis is placed on web scraping detection methods, including rate limiting,
use of reverse proxies with bot-blocking rules, and detection using browser fingerprinting.
The scraper and detection methods were presented as a case study, using a research platform (an online store).
The described and implemented detections were tested in various scenarios, both individually and in their combination.
Attention was paid to the importance of web scraping as a tool for effective data acquisition, as well as to the essence of effective methods for its detection.
